**Abstract**

Connections between classical and quantum integrable systems are
analyzed from the viewpoint of Slavnov products of Bethe states. It is
well known that, modulo model dependent aspects, the functional
structure of Slavnov products generally takes the form of
determinants. Building on recent results on the structure of rational
and trigonometric models, we show that, provided certain conditions
are satisfied, the Slavnov product of a given model can be interpreted
as a tau function of the KP hierarchy, thus extending known results in
a more general setting. Moreover, we show that Slavnov products can be
expanded in terms of other tau functions. We also prove that their
homogeneous limit can be systematically expressed as a Wronskian of
functions related to the eigenvalues of the transfer
matrices. Finally, we compute the Baker-Akhiezer functions associated
with these Slavnov products and show that, apart from a universal
multiplicative factor, they admit a closed determinantal
representation.
